            <h2>Mechanical Switches</h2>
            <p>
              There are three main types of switches: linear, tactile, and
              clicky. Linear and tactile switches are the most commonly used
              ones in the hobby, while clicky and tactile switches are more
              common in prebuilt keyboards that are marketed towards gamers.
              That is not to say linear switches are not "gamer friendly", but
              most people's first keyboards are ones with clicky or tactile
              switches.
            </p>
            <p>
              Each of the different types have a different feel to them, so it
              depends on one's personal preference between the types. And even
              among the same category, there are a plethora of options to choose
              from, so you can get really specific with your switches, from the
              weight resistance to the material of the switch, which does affect
              the sound profile from the switch.

              <h2>Types of Switches</h2>
              <h3>Linear</h3>
              <p>
                These are considered great for gaming and daily typing because
                they're light to press, and they don't offer any tactile
                feedback, but again, this comes down to personal preference.
                There's no bump before the actuation point. Linear switches are
                also quiet, so they won't bother people around you.
              </p>
              <h3>Tactile</h3>
              <p>
                Tactile switches are likely the most popular switch type on the
                market. They're known to have a good balance between typing and
                gaming because they offer good tactile feedback and, depending
                on the brand, aren't very heavy to press. This is ideal for
                typing, as you'll know when you're about to register a keypress,
                and it helps reduce typos. If you're looking for your first
                mechanical keyboard, they're a good place to start. They're also
                quiet compared to other switch types, but it may produce a lot
                of noise if you tend to bottom-out the keys.
              </p>
              <h3>Clicky</h3>
              <p>
                Clicky switches are extremely similar to tactile switches. They
                provide the same tactile feedback, making them very popular for
                typing, and they produce an audible click. This could be
                particularly problematic if you work in an open-office
                environment, as the loud noise may bother people around you.

            <h2>Lubing Switches</h2>
            <p>
              In the hobby, it is almost mandatory to lube your switches. This
              process involves opening up every single switch you plan to use in
              your build, and apply certain lube to certain areas. This proces
              drastically improves the feel and acoustics of your build. It is a
              very time-consuming and mundane task, however the result is well
              worth the time and effort that is put into. Below you will see a
              quick video explaining the benefits and the before and after of
              lubing your switches.
