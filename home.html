          <h2>What Are Mechanical Keyboards?</h2>
          <p>
            Mechanical Keyboards are keyboards that utilizes mechanical switches
            to provide a more fun typing experience that comes along with
            amazing sound profiles. Unlike a typical office membrane keyboard,
            which feels mushy to the touch, mechanical switches provide a more
            firmer and physical press, due to the spring inside. Combined with a
            variety of sizes and materials for the case, or body, of the
            keyboard, you can get different acoustic profiles out of your
            keyboard.
