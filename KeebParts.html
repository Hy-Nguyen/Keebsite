            <h2><a href="keycaps.html">Keycaps</a></h2>
            <p>
              Keycaps are the main factor in determinging the visible aesthetic
              of your keyboard, along side with the keyboard case. They also
              contribute to the sound signature of the board based on material
              and keycap size.

            <h2><a href="switch.html">Switches</a></h2>
            <p>
              Switches are the main component that determines the feel of the
              keyboards typing experience. They also provide different sound
              signatures based on the material of the switches. They are
              composed of bottom and top housing, the spring, and the stem of
              the switch.

          <h2><a href="Plate.html">Plates</a></h2>
          <p>
            The plate is the secondary factor is determining the feel of a
            keyboard. The common materials are aluminium, FR4, Polycarbonate and
            POM. It determies the flex of the typing experience and can slightly
            contribute to the sound signature of the keyboard.
          </p>

          <h2><a href="PCB.html">PCB</a></h2>
          <p>
            The PCB is the brain of the keyboard. It is what connects and
            communicates to the computer what keys are being activated. Some
            manufactures has implemented flex cuts into the PCB in order to make
            the typing feel a little more bouncy and softer.
          </p>

        <div class="section">
          <h2><a href="Case.html">Case</a></h2>
          <p>
            The case is another major part of the aesthetic appeal of the
            keyboard. This is where designers spend most of their creative
            efforts to add chamfers or other design adjustments in order to
            differentiate their boards from other designers'. Most premium
            boards are made of aluminium and include a brass weight in order to
            add some weight to the board so that it feels more hefty and
            premium.
