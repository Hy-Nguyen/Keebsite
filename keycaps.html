      <h1>Keycaps</h1>
      <h2>Material</h2>
      <p>
        Keycaps are mainly made from two types of plastic, ABS and PBT. These
        different material offer different acoustic responses and have different
        longevity. Many basic office keyboards are made with ABS keycaps, while
        more premium and hobbyist keycaps are made from PBT.
      </p>
      <p>
        The main difference between these two materials comes down to its
        longevity and sound profile. ABS keycaps develop a shine a lot faster,
        however they create a more higher pitched acoustic sound. You often see
        this shine on used office keyboards, where the middle of the keycaps
        have a shine on them, as opposed to a newer set of ABS keycap.

      <p>
        PBT keycaps however, have a longer lifetime. This means that it takes
        longer for them to develop the shine that we see on keycaps. Although it
        is not completely preventable, PBT does take longer to shine. There are
        also other ways one can prevent their keycaps from shining. Most
        hobbyists own more than one set of keycaps, so rotating keycaps to
        ensure a longer life period is a common practice. However, if that is
        not an option, making sure you have clean and oil-free fingers/hands
        before use will also help.
      </p>
      <h2>Layouts</h2>
      <p>
        When purchasing keycaps, it is important to keep in mind the layout of
        the keyboard you want to build. Most common sizes are covered by
        standard base kits, however many keycap sets offer additional add-ons,
        such as spacebar and numbar kits. These additional kits can add both
        aestheic or functional keys to your keyboard, as you might want more
        accent colors, or your keyboard might contain a number pad.
